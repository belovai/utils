# Utils

A collection of small, useful scripts I use regularly.

- [chrono](./chrono)
  Convert Unix timestamps to human-readable datetime, or print the current timestamp.
- [dphp](./dphp)
  Run PHP inside a Docker container with an explicitly selected PHP version.
- [follow](./follow)  
  Trace full HTTP redirect chains using curl, showing every step.
- [teleport](./teleport)  
  Quickly SSH into a host from your `~/.ssh/config` using `fzf` for fuzzy selection.
