# Utils

A collection of small, useful scripts I use regularly.

- [dphp](./dphp)
  Run PHP inside a Docker container with an explicitly selected PHP version.
- [teleport](./teleport)  
  Quickly SSH into a host from your `~/.ssh/config` using `fzf` for fuzzy selection.
- [ts2date](./ts2date)
  Convert Unix timestamps to human-readable datetime, or print the current timestamp.
